# ponpon

Credit to my GalaCon friends for this idea lol

it literally just proxies all calls to `ponpon` and `ponponx` to `pnpm` and `pnpx`. you get no benefit using this over pnpm

## installation

`npm i -g ponpon`

## usage

use as you would use pnpm, except replace `pnpm` with `ponpon`, and `pnpx` with `ponponx`

Alternatively, just use pnpm directly

## versions

- `ponpon@1.0.0` -> `pnpm@5.15.1` *deprecated, use 1.0.1 instead, this one didn't work*
- `ponpon@1.0.1` -> `pnpm@5.15.1`
